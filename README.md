## How to use this template?

- Mentee should fork this template.
- Mentor should join in as a contributor.

This template is designed to assist Twoleaps mentorship program. The template consists of two 
major sections: Goals and Progress tracker. Mentors and mentee should add goals prior to start of 
mentorship. Both Parties should have agreement on the goals. Progress tracker is to be updated on week

has to be maintained which captures the work done. It can be a small essay of things learned to code
